# Project Template

A repository to hold NEFSC code for extracting data for the Cost of Climate Change project.  

# Overview and Folder structure

This is mostly borrowed from the world bank's EDB. https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices
Please use forward slashes (that is C:/path/to/your/folder) instead of backslashes for unix/mac compatability. I'm forgetful about this. 

I keep each project in a separate folder.  A stata do file containing folder names get stored as a macro in stata's startup profile.do.  This lets me start working on any of my projects by opening stata and typing: 
```
do $my_project_name
```
Rstudio users using projects don't have to do this step.  But it is convenient to read paths into variables by using the "R_paths_libraries.R" file.


# On passwords and other confidential information

Basically, you will want to store them in a place that does not get uploaded to github. 

For stata users, there is a description [here](/documentation/project_logistics.md). 

For R users, try storing it in [.Rprofile](/R_code/project_logistics/.Rprofile_sample). Store you API keys or Personal Access Tokens in [.Renviron](/R_code/project_logistics/.Renviron_sample)
